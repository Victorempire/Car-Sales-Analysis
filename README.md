## FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
## The Time series Analysis Dashboard
-	The Line Chart indicate that in 2022, September, November and December collectively contributed 44.15% of Total Sales, and in 2023, the same months Collectively Generated 42.37 % of Total Sales.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
## Sales Strategy Optimization
- Since September, November, and December account for a significant portion of sales, manufacturers and dealerships should increase marketing efforts, promotional discounts, and inventory during these months.
-	 Implement targeted promotions or financing incentives in January, February, and March to stimulate demand during slow months.
-	Since 80.16% of sales occur on weekdays, dealerships should ensure extended business hours, special weekday promotions, and streamlined purchasing processes.
## Market Positioning
-	Since the top 10 manufacturers generate nearly 43% of sales, dealerships should prioritize stocking vehicles from these brands to align with customer demand.
-	Identify the challenges affecting sales of the bottom 10 manufacturers (e.g., pricing, features, reliability) and strategize on repositioning these brands through better marketing or competitive pricing.
-	Increase Awareness for Top-Selling Models, Despite being top sellers, these models only account for 16.16% of total sales. Expanding marketing campaigns, increasing dealership incentives, and refining product messaging could help boost their market share.

## Forecasting and Inventory Planning
-	With sales projected to continue growing but at a decreasing rate (23.59% in 2023 down to 13.81% in 2026), manufacturers should adjust production levels accordingly to avoid overstocking or supply shortages.
-	 Dealerships should stock more vehicles that align with projected sales trends and adjust procurement based on forecasted demand.
-	Given the positive correlation between customer income and sales, dealerships and manufacturers should introduce flexible financing options or tiered pricing strategies to cater to different income segments.
-	Since income levels drive car sales, dealerships should focus on regions with higher-income customers by tailoring advertisements and product availability to match purchasing power.
